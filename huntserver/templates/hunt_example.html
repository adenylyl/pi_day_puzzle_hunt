<!-- 
This is a sample template for a hunt. There are some things to note:
- PLEASE DON'T EDIT THIS FILE. Make a copy and edit that. the server will 
  automatically look for a file named "hunt#.html" where # is the current hunt 
  number.

- You almost certainly want to keep the line {% extends "hunt_base.html" %} at
  the top. It is what provides various css/js files as well as the navbar at
  the top of the page. 

- The title is just what is displayed in the browser tab, change it if you want.

- Put all of the page content inside the content block tags or you wont see it.

- If you want to add more CSS, source the file in a block named "includes" see 
  the title block (or django docs) for syntax of a block.

- If you want to remove the current CSS for the page, create an empty block 
  named "base_includes".

- This template is passed a sorted list of puzzles (sorted by puzzle number), 
  the team that is currently logged in, and a list of puzzles that the team 
  has solved.
