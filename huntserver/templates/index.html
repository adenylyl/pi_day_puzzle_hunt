    <h2>What is a puzzle hunt?</h2>
    <p>
      A puzzle hunt is an event where people get together to solve carefully designed puzzles which somehow link together. 
      They're not your typical math puzzle, but rather require you to connect concepts in out-of-the-box ways to get a solution 
      (usually a word or phrase). Once you've solved several, you'll reach the meta puzzle, for which you need to incorporate 
      all of the solutions you've found to make sense of.O ur puzzle hunt's structure changes from semester to semester so as to 
      provide new challenges for solvers, but you can check out our past hunts <a href= "https://sites.google.com/site/rmhspihunt"> here</a>. </p>
